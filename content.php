	<ul>
		<li>Use PHP</li>
		<li>Access the database</li>
		<li>Commit changes and push them to the repository</li>
		<li>Pull other people's changes in from the repository</li>
		<li>Play nice, by working in branches</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Pages Available</h3>
	<em>These page links are constructed dynamically by reading the <b>page</b> table in the database.</em>
